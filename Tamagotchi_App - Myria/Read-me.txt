Tamagotchi App developed by Myria (Patrick), Lucas, and Harry.

The Tamagotchi gif is an image made by the owner of https://tientit.wordpress.com/page/2/. 
It has a creative commons liscence, and we are free to use it commercially. 
We cropped it to better fit the program, but that is all we have modifed in it.

Before running the program, make sure that python is up to date, you do not need to install any external libraries, as we have just used the inbuilt python libraries

To start the game, simply run the Main.py Python file.
